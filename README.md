Implement DE to solve Booth function (The function is defined on 2-dimensional space. 
The function has one global minimum at: f(x) = 0 at x = (1,3).)

The function is usually evaluated on the square xi 2 [10; 10];

Refer https://www.sfu.ca/~ssurjano/booth.html to find the details

Implement the solution using separate functions.

Present and discuss the results appropriately. (number of runs, time, accuracy, etc.)
